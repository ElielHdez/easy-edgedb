# Welcome!

Welcome to the tutorial to easily learn EdgeDB in plain English.

In this course, we will be using EdgeDB and its query language EdgeQL to put together a database. We will imagine that we are creating the database for a game that is based on the book Bram Stoker's Dracula. Because the game is going to use the events in the book, we need a database to tie everything together. It will need to show the connections between the characters, locations, dates, and more.

# Chapter 1 - Jonathan Harker heads towards Transylvania

In the beginning of the book, we see the main character Jonathan Harker who a young lawyer who is going to meet a client. The client is a nobleman named Count Dracula who lives somewhere in Eastern Europe. Jonathan still doesn't know that Count Dracula is a vampire, so he is enjoying the trip. Here is how the book begins:

>3 May. Bistritz.â€”Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train...

This is already a lot of information, and it helps us start to think about our database schema. EdgeQL uses something called [SDL (schema definition language)](https://edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/sdl/index#ref-eql-sdl) that makes migration easy. So far our schema needs the following:

- Some kind of City or Location type. Cities should have a name and a location, and sometimes a different name or spelling. Bistritz for example in the book is now called BistriÈ›a, and Buda-Pesth is now written Budapest.
- Some kind of Person type. We need it to have a name, and also a way to track the places that the person visited.
 
To make a type in EdgeQL, just use the keyword `type` followed by the type name, then `{}` curly brackets. Our `Person` type will start out like this:

```
type Person {
}
```

Inside this we insert the properties for our `Person` type. Type `required property` if the type needs it, and just `property` if it is optional. 

```
type Person {
  required property name -> str;
  property places_visited -> array<str>;
}
```

A `str` is just a string, and is written inside either single quotes: `'Jonathan Harker'` or double quotes: `"Jonathan Harker"`. An `array` is a collection type, and our array here is an array of `str`s. We want it to look like this: `["Bistritz", "Vienna", "Buda-Pesth"]`. With that we can easily search later and see which character has visited where.

`places_visited` is not a `required` property because we will probably start adding people that we don't care too much about.

Now for our City type:

```
type City {
  required property name -> str;
  property modern_name -> str;
}
```

Later on we can think about adding time zones and locations for the cities for our imaginary game. But in the meantime, we will add some items to the database using `INSERT`. By the way, keywords in EdgeDB are case insensitive, so `INSERT`, `insert` and `InSeRT` are all the same. But using capital letters is the normal practice for databases so it's best to use that.

We use the `:=` operator to declare, while `=` is used for equality (not `==`).

```
INSERT Person {
    name := 'Jonathan Harker',
    places_visited := ["Bistritz", "Vienna", "Buda-Pesth"],
}

INSERT City {
    name := 'Munich'
}

INSERT City {
    name := 'Buda-Pesth'
    modern_name := 'Budapest'
}

INSERT City {
    name := 'Bistritz'
    modern_name := 'BistriÈ›a'
}
```

As you can see, `str`s are fine with unicode letters like È›. Even emojis are just fine: you could create a `City` called 'ðŸ¤ ' if you wanted to.
